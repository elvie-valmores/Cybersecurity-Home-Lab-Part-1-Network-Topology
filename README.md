# Cybersecurity Home Lab Part 1: Network Topology

## Objective
The objective of Part 1 in the Cybersecurity Home Lab is to design and implement a robust network topology using VirtualBox. This serves as the foundation for the entire lab, which includes setting up VMs.

### Home Lab Overview
- **pfSense** (Gateway & Firewall): Acts as the main firewall and router for the lab network, ensuring that all VMs are securely managed.
- **Kali Linux** (Management VM): Used for administration and testing.
- **Active Directory Lab** (Domain Controller & 2 Clients): Provides the environment for managing and testing Windows services.
- **Malware Analysis Lab** (Windows & Linux): A separate environment for analyzing malware without risking the rest of the network.
- **Security VMs** (DFIR & SIEM): Dedicated virtual machines for Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM).
- **Cyber Range** (Vulnerable VMs for CTF practice): Vulnerable virtual machines designed for Capture The Flag (CTF) practice and testing.
